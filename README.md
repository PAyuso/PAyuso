## 🧠 About Me

Hi! I'm a PhD researcher specializing in **generative diffusion models**, with a strong background in **machine learning**, **embedded systems**, and software development using **Python** and **C**.

My current research focuses on:
- Enhancing the **efficiency** and **controllability** of diffusion-based models
- Applying them to **Pedestrian Attribute Recognition (PAR)** to generate high-quality synthetic images
- Addressing challenges of **data scarcity** and **attribute alignment** in visual recognition tasks

🧑‍💼 I also worked as a **Software Developer at GMV**, where I contributed to the development of robust software solutions in Galileo (GNSS system) in the key part
OSPF (Orbit Determination and Synchronization Processing Facility) in the RTMC (Real-Time Monitoring and Control) proyect.

🔧 Always exploring ideas at the intersection of AI, vision, and real-world applications.

## 📚 Publications

- **[Enhancing Zero-Shot Pedestrian Attribute Recognition with Synthetic Data
Generation: A Comparative Study with Image-To-Image Diffusion Models]()**  
  *Authors:* Pablo Ayuso-Albizu, Juan C. SanMiguel, Pablo Carballeira.                                                             
  *Conference:* IEEE AVSS 2025 – Accepted  
  _Exploring key points from diffusion models as strenght and scale with image to image pipeline. Also, prompt-image alignment and image properties. Moreover, three data augmentation methods based on diffusion models were explored and selected one to improve the system between 1-4% in mA._

- **[A Data-Centric Approach to Pedestrian Attribute Recognition:
Synthetic Augmentation via Prompt-driven Diffusion Models]()**  
  *Authors:* Alejandro Alonso, Sawaiz A. Chaudhry, Juan C. SanMiguel, Alvaro García-Martín, Pablo Ayuso-Albizu, Pablo Carballeira.  
  *Conference:* IEEE AVSS 2025 – Accepted 
  _In this work is focus on text to image pipeline. Analysing which attributes should be generated. Also, a modification of the binary loss were introduced. The results shows that generating synthetic images could improve the attribute recognition._
